*	Password doesn’t start with a Number (Score = 10)
*	Password has at least 8 characters (Score = 10)
*	Password has lowercase characters (Score = 15)
*	Password has uppercase characters (Score = 15)
*	Password contains more than 2 special characters (Score = 25)
*	Password contains more than 2 numbers (Score = 25)


## Running the Program and Tests:


	For the Program, just run “python -u passwordchecker.py”
	To run the tests, just run “python -u test_passwordchecker.py”


# File Parser:

File Parser is also made in a simple and minimalistic coding practice. It takes the ‘logfile.txt’ as the input and outputs into 3 different files ‘Error.txt’, ’Debug.txt’, ’Info.txt’.


## Running the Tests and Program:
	
        For the program, just run “python fileparse.py”
	For the Tests, just run “test_fileparse.py”


# SQL:


SQL queries is written in basic SQL because in the Question it wasn’t specified that I must run it in a python-based script. If so kindly let me know and I will do the necessary changes.
